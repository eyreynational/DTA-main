<p> 
    Diabetes is a disease caused by reduced insulin in a patient. Diabetes patient's if not attended to quiickly could 
    lose the lives. Using the knowledge of machine learning, we have been able to come up with a solution on how 
     easily predict if a patient is a diabetes patient by receiving information from the Health worker in charge of the 
    Patient.
